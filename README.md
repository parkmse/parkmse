**Embedded Systems Engineer in Progress**  
Linux-based System Integration | Real-Time Control | Hardware-Oriented Development  

I design and build software that runs on real hardware.  
Focused on C-based embedded systems, Linux board integration, and system-level architecture.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I believe embedded systems are not just about writing code,  
but understanding how software interacts with hardware.

I focus on:

- Deterministic system behavior  
- Stable real-time processing  
- Reliable inter-board communication  
- Clean and modular system architecture
